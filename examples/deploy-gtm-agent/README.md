# deploy-gtm-agent

A go-to-market strategy agent deployed with `deepagents deploy`. Given a product or feature, it coordinates a **sync** market-researcher subagent and an **async** content-writer subagent to produce a full GTM plan with supporting marketing materials.

This example demonstrates the sync/async subagent pattern: market research blocks on results before strategy is written, while content creation runs in the background and is integrated when ready.

## Prerequisites

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Model access (gpt-5.4-nano) |
| `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` | Required for deploy |

Copy `.env` and fill in your keys.

## Deploy

```bash
deepagents deploy
```

The subagents defined under `subagents/` are automatically discovered and wired in at deploy time.

## What to try

Once deployed, open the agent in LangSmith and send it prompts like:

- `"We're launching a new Python SDK for AI agents next month — build me a GTM plan"`
- `"Help us position our vector database product against Pinecone and Weaviate"`
- `"We're targeting mid-market engineering teams — what channels should we prioritize?"`

The agent will kick off market research, synthesize a strategy, and produce content briefs in parallel.

## Query via SDK

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="https://<your-deployment-url>")
thread = await client.threads.create()

async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    thread["thread_id"], "agent",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Build a GTM plan for our new Python SDK for AI agents"}]},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    print(chunk.data, end="", flush=True)
```

Find your deployment URL in LangSmith under **Deployments**. See the [LangGraph SDK docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/sdk/) for more.
